# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
This portfolio includes a collection of projects from my Master's in Data Analytics from Western Governors University as well as other personal projects completed outside of my degree.  This serves to showcase my skills in Python, Excel, SQL and Tableau throughout the stages of the data analytics lifecycle.
